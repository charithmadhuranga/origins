## Reporting bugs

Many bugs can't be reproduced unless specific steps are taken. Please **specify
the exact steps** that must be taken to reproduce the condition, and try to
keep them as minimal as possible. Don't hesitate to include screenshots.

Making your bug report easy to reproduce will make it easier for contributors
to fix the bug.

## Contributing to Game's translation

In the future, when the game gets bigger, you can help us translate it.
I only speak Brazilian Portuguese and English, so if you want to help me
translate the game into other languages, your help will be gratefully accepted.

## Communicating with the developer

To communicate with me (e.g. to discuss a feature you want to implement
or a bug you want to fix), you can contact with me directly on my discord
``Akura#2918``.Feel free to start discussing something there to get some
early feedback before writing up a detailed proposal in a GitHub issue.
